Deep within the earth's core, there lies a demon named AREXXANZJE. His backstory is not important if you did not participate in any other puzzle hunts or ARGs, but understand that he thought of himself as...a blacksmith of pain.<br />
<br />
And that he always thought: I "Will Smith": myself an entity. A person made of steel, of adamantium...or some other type of metal.<br />
<br />
But he didn't know who to reach out to, to be the starting point. He needs someone in pop culture right now who could be a Steel Guy. Not a man OF steel, but one who wears it, perhaps?<br />
<br />
Reach out to him on gmail with the answer as the subject.
