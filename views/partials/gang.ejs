<i>How are we gonna crack this gang, boss?</i><br />
<b>It's simple. First, we figure out the base they're in.</b><br />
<i>Right, right, and once we do there will be 8 suspects.</i><br />
<b>Correct. We've got to keep them in the order they give us for now, but turn each one around.</b><br />
<i>Alright, nice, then we reverse them as a whole, right?</i><br />
<b>You've got this, yeah! Now we've got them right where we want them, so we force them to join together!</b><br />
<i>...OK, that's...weird, but OK, sure. But last I heard, a hex had been cast on them. We'll need to convert them.</i><br />
<b>Duh. But then, just to get the best result out of them, we reverse their entire gang AGAIN!</b><br />
<i>You're a genius, boss.</i><br />
