Listen up, I'm going to need you to help me drill: down into this MEGA tough situation and figure out what happened, alright?<br />
<br />
So you took the time machine on May 3rd, 2112, correct? And what day of the week was that? Perfect.<br />
<br />
Then you travelled back exactly 577 days. And what month is that? Alright alright.<br />
<br />
Then you went even FURTHER back, going fifty years, six months and...thirty weeks and thirty days? What month was THAT?<br />
<br />
And then you landed...Huh. 5 centuries, 18 months, 6 weeks and one day further back. What month was this?<br />
<br />
I think we have enough to book you now, I just need to look at these notes.
