Congratulations, you solved the final puzzle! If you are seeing this, message JD on the Discord (he is JDllama) and tell him the final answer, and if you are one of the first five to solve this, you will receive a prize!<br />
<br />
If you liked this puzzle hunt, MIT does a yearly puzzle hunt in January that you can participate online (imagine this, but better written and with 100+ puzzles!). If you're interested, hit me up and let me know.<br />
