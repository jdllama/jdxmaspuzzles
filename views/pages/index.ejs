Hello and welcome to a puzzle of fun and of mystery fun!<br />
<br />
So here's how this works. <b><a href="./random">Click here</a></b> for a random puzzle. You will get a currently unsolved puzzle. If there are no unsolved puzzles left, the page will break.<br />
<br />
You will use what you get to solve the Meta puzzles. Once you have those solved, you use that to solve the final puzzle.<br />
<br />
Teamwork is not required, but is encouraged. However, the first five people who solve the final puzzle will receive a small prize!<br />
<br />
There are currently <%=remaining;%> out of <%=total;%> puzzles, <%=remainingMeta;%> out of <%=totalMeta;%> Meta, and <%=remainingFinal;%> out of <%=totalFinal;%> final puzzles unsolved. The meta puzzles can be found <a href="/meta">here.</a> The final puzzle is <a href="/final">here.</a> Want a random puzzle, click <a href="/random">here!</a><br />
<br />
Quick tips:<br />
<br />
None of the puzzles require brute forcing or trying to hack this site. If any of this is detected, the puzzle hunt will be shut down immediately.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, to save you a headache, there are no hints on this page, and if there is a bitly then you will be clued to it. I swear.<br />
<br />
Also, to keep things easy for spoilers, there's a Discord <a href="http://discord.gg/8AMPd4A" target="_blank">here</a> to chat / work on puzzles together.
<br />
<% if(allGuessed.length == 0) { %>
Sorry, no one's solved any puzzles yet!
<% } else { %>
Here are the currently solved ones:<br />
<br />
  <% for(var i = 0;i<allGuessed.length;i++) { %>
    <a href="/<%=allGuessed[i].name;%>" target="_blank"><%=allGuessed[i].title;%></a><br />
