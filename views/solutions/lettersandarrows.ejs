Look at your keyboard. Look at a letter listed in the puzzle, then for every arrow direction, move that way one key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
For example, the first one, you start on V, and then step to the right twice; that puts you on the letter N.<br />
<br />
Do that with the others and you'll get "NIXON" which is the answer.
