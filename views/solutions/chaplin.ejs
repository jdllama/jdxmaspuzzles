How's this for a weird email address: AREXXANZJE@gmail.com<br />
<br />
The puzzle clues to "Robert Downey Jr." Email that address with that as the title, and you'll get an auto response. Hidden in the response is invisible text that says "Send me another email with the subject "Faxanadu" minus the quotes."<br />
<br />
If you do this, you'll get another auto response, this time it just says "In the Valley of Elah lies Three Burials. The Fugitive, The Client, and The Missing. I need to know who to go to, so Hope Springs again."<br />
<br />
Those are some real Tommy Lee Jones references, which is the answer.
