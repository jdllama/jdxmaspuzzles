The list of words doesn't have anything in common at first glance, but the thought of "Frogger" means we're looking at ways to cross over. Weird.<br />
<br />
All of the words combined are 76 letters in length; furthermore, it actually divides evenly at the halfway point.<br />
<br />
So if you write the first five words all on one line, then the last six words and write them immediately underneath the words, with no spaces, only certain letters are actually shared across both rows. Those letters spell out "KADABRA".<br />
