Each group of words only has one thing in common amongst themselves; the distribution of consonants and vowels. If you treat it like binary, where each vowel is a 1 and each consonant is a 0, each section becomes a number.<br />

If you chooose that number letter of the alphabet (1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, etc.), you get "APEX TIP TOP" which is the answer.
